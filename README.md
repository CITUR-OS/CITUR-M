create iso to use Rosehip

run init.sh in linux to create the iso (this might take up to five hours!)

in the iso run the word rosehip to open the desktop

make sure you are using internet which doesn't require any special certificate.

right now the only problem is Rosehip is written for windows but the iso is linux formated...
